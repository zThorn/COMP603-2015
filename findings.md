#[GO Compiler](https://github.com/golang)


##Scan
The scanner in the go compiler is available [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/go/scanner/scanner.go).  It works largely by making calls to next() at line 56, and Scan() at line 598.

##Tokenize
The tokenizer is available [here](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/go/token), with all of the tokens being defined in token.go

##Parse
The go parser is available [here](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/go/parser).  The main parser is located at parser.go , and test cases are available in parser_test.go.

##AST
The AST generator is [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/go/ast/ast.go).

##Optimization & Code generation.
The code for generating a build is located in [this](https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/go/build) directory, specifically [here.](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/go/build/build.go)

##Interesting things
Within the AST.go file, the assumption 
lines := make([]string, 0, 10) // most comments are less than 10 lines
is made.
Additionally I found the following comment:
// NewIdent creates a new Ident without position.
// Useful for ASTs generated by code other than the Go parser.
which suggests GO supports using replacement parsers, while using the rest of the compiler.
